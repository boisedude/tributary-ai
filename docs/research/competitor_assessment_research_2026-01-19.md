## Executive Summary

The findings reveal clear patterns in naming conventions, deliverables, value propositions, pricing, frameworks, and differentiation strategies.

## 1. Naming Conventions

| Term | Usage Context |
|------|---------------|

## 3. Frameworks Used

Most firms use 6-8 dimensions, not just PPT:

**RSM's Eight Dimensions:**
- Business and strategy readiness, process readiness, technical architecture, data readiness, talent and skills, governance and policies, security and risk, organizational alignment

**TBM's Seven Dimensions (Operations-Focused):**
- Leadership, asset condition, digital maturity, management systems, S&OP, quality, automation

**The Hackett Group's Six Pillars:**
- Strategy and Resources, Organization, Technology Enablers, Data, Performance and Application, Ethical/Equitable/Responsible Use

## 4. Value Proposition Messaging

### PE-Focused Firms (A&M, TBM, FTI):
- "EBITDA improvements of 20-30%+"
- "EBITDA gains from 5% up to 25%"
- "$13 million / 500 basis points of EBITDA improvement achievable in 12-15 months"

### Middle-Market Focused (RSM, CBIZ):
- "91% of middle-market respondents use generative AI, but 53% feel only 'somewhat prepared'"
- "Only 8% of mid-sized companies achieve operational maturity"

### Anti-Hype Positioning:
- "Only 23% of heavily promoted AI innovations deliver measurable ROI within the first year"
- "80% of AI projects fail to deliver intended outcomes"
- "Nearly 90% of portfolio company AI use cases never move beyond the pilot stage"

---

## 5. Differentiation Strategies That Work

1. **Operations-first, not technology-first** - "We fix processes before adding AI"
2. **EBITDA-focused** - Every recommendation tied to financial impact
3. **Anti-hype positioning** - "Realistic assessment, not technology promises"
4. **Quantify everything** - Specific percentages, dollar amounts, timeframes
5. **Industry specificity** - Specialized consultants command 30-40% fee premiums

---

## 6. Notable Boutique Firms

**Third Stage Consulting**
- Focus: ERP and AI readiness for mid-market
- Key Message: Data readiness matters more than AI tools

**TBM Consulting Group**
- Focus: Lean operations, manufacturing, PE portfolio companies
- Key Message: "$2 Billion in EBITDA benefits since 2019"

**Opinosis Analytics**
- Focus: Healthcare AI consulting
- Key Message: Faster time to value, measurable results

---

## 7. Contrarian Themes in Market

**"Your Operations Aren't Ready for AI"**
- "AI can't optimize what it can't understand" - fix data/processes first
- "Nearly 90% of portfolio company AI use cases never move beyond pilot stage"

**"AI Hype is Oversold"**
- Only 23% deliver ROI in year one
- $900 billion of $1.3 trillion spent on digital transformation was wasted

**"Process Before Technology"**
- "You can't bolt AI onto broken processes"

## 8. Implications for Tributary AI

### Positioning Validation
Tributary's position ("AI should reduce spend, not increase it") is MORE contrarian than the market. Most say "get ready for AI" - Tributary says "simplify."

### Pricing Validation
$25K-$35K for 2 weeks is competitive with market.

### Framework Consideration
4 dimensions (People/Process/Technology/Politics) is simpler than market standard (6-8). Could be a differentiator (simplicity) or a gap (less comprehensive). Consider whether Politics replaces multiple governance/culture dimensions.

### Target Customer Insight
- PE portfolio companies are a hot segment (value creation language)
- Mid-market is underserved (only 8% achieve operational maturity)
- Industry specialization commands premium pricing
