## Key Deliverability Practices

1. **Dedicated sending domains** - never use primary domain
2. **SPF, DKIM, DMARC** - authenticate all sending domains
3. **Warmup period** - 4-6 weeks before scaling
4. **Volume consistency** - avoid spikes
5. **Clean lists** - verify emails before sending
6. **No tracking pixels initially** - improves deliverability
