# AI Readiness Assessment Framework: Comprehensive Research Report

**Prepared for:** Tributary AI
**Date:** January 28, 2026
**Subject:** Five-Dimension Framework for AI Readiness Assessment

---

## Executive Summary

This report synthesizes research from five specialized domain experts across the critical dimensions of AI readiness: **Data**, **People**, **Process**, **Technology**, and **Politics**. The findings provide a comprehensive foundation for Tributary's AI Assessment offering, identifying key metrics, maturity scoring frameworks, common blockers, diagnostic questions, and remediation strategies for each dimension.

### Key Findings

| Dimension | Weight | Critical Stat | Top Blocker |
|-----------|--------|---------------|-------------|
| **Data** | 25% | Only 12% report AI-ready data quality | Data silos (87% of organizations) |
| **Technology** | 20% | Only 26% have robust GPU infrastructure | Legacy systems (85% concerned) |
| **People** | 20% | 52% lack AI talent/skills | Skills gap (62% cite as top challenge) |
| **Process** | 15% | 55% cite outdated processes as AI barrier | Undocumented processes |
| **Governance** | 10% | 91% need better AI governance | EU AI Act compliance (Aug 2026) |
| **Politics** | 10% | 70% of AI failures are people/politics | Lack of executive sponsorship |

**Critical Insight:** 95% of enterprise generative AI initiatives show no measurable P&L impact, primarily due to weak integration with existing workflows and lack of organizational readiness—not technology limitations.

## COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS: CURRENT QUIZ VS. RESEARCH

### Current Quiz Strengths

1. **Six-Dimension Coverage:** The quiz already includes Data, Technology, People, Process, Governance, and Politics—matching industry best practices.

2. **Weighted Scoring:** Data (25%), Technology (20%), People (20%), Process (15%), Governance (10%), Politics (10%)—aligns with research recommendations.

3. **Veto Threshold:** The 1.5 average score veto logic correctly prevents false positives where strong areas mask critical weaknesses.

4. **Behavioral Question Framing:** Questions like "If a new employee asked 'How does X work here?'" use behavioral indicators rather than abstract concepts.

5. **Politics Dimension:** A key differentiator—most assessments overlook this critical factor.

### Gaps Identified from Research

| Area | Current Quiz | Research Recommendation |
|------|--------------|------------------------|
| Data Lineage | Not directly addressed | Add question on traceability and audit trails |
| MLOps Maturity | Not addressed | Add Technology question on CI/CD for models |
| Automation Anxiety | Partially covered | More explicit question on workforce fear levels |
| Cross-Functional Collaboration | Implied | Direct question on departmental collaboration |
| Historical Initiative Success | Strong (politics-2) | Excellent coverage |
| Skills Gap Measurement | Not directly measured | Consider adding talent/skills question |
| Compliance Readiness | governance-1 covers basics | Could add EU AI Act awareness |

### Recommended Quiz Additions (Optional Phase 2)

1. **Data Lineage Question:**
   > "Can your organization trace where data comes from and how it's transformed before reaching AI models?"

2. **MLOps Question:**
   > "How does your organization deploy and monitor AI/machine learning models in production?"

3. **Workforce Anxiety Question:**
   > "How would employees describe their feelings about AI's impact on their roles?"

4. **Cross-Functional Collaboration Question:**
   > "When AI initiatives require cooperation across departments, what typically happens?"

---

## WEBSITE IMPROVEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. Assessment Page (`/assessment`)

**Current:** Five dimensions (Data, People, Process, Technology, Politics)
**Recommendation:** Already strong. Consider:
- Adding percentage statistics to each dimension (e.g., "87% of organizations struggle with data silos")
- Including industry benchmark comparisons in deliverables
- Highlighting the veto threshold concept ("Critical gaps prevent overall success regardless of other strengths")

### 2. Quiz Results Enhancement

**Current:** Shows dimension breakdown with percentages
**Recommendation:**
- Add industry benchmarks next to scores ("Your Data score: 62% | Industry average: 45%")
- Show "veto risk" indicators for dimensions below 40%
- Link weakest dimensions to relevant blog posts or Assessment service

### 3. New Content Opportunities

Based on the research, consider creating:

| Content Type | Topic | Target Keyword |
|--------------|-------|----------------|
| Blog Post | "Why 95% of AI Pilots Fail (And How to Beat the Odds)" | AI pilot failure rate |
| Blog Post | "The Politics of AI: The Hidden Dimension Everyone Ignores" | AI organizational politics |
| Blog Post | "Data Quality: The #1 Predictor of AI Success" | AI data quality |
| Case Study | Assessment → Data Readiness → AI Success Journey | AI assessment ROI |
| Infographic | "5 Dimensions of AI Readiness Maturity Model" | AI readiness framework |

### 4. Assessment Offer Enhancements

**Current Deliverables:**
- Findings Document
- Leadership Presentation
- Scorecard + Roadmap

**Recommended Additions:**
1. **Dimension Maturity Scores (1-5)** for each of the 5 dimensions
2. **Industry Benchmarking** where available
3. **"Veto Condition" Alerts** for critical weaknesses
4. **Quick Win Roadmap** with 30/60/90-day actions for each dimension
5. **Assessment Questions Template** for ongoing self-evaluation

### 5. Service Positioning

**Current:** "Two-week diagnostic"
**Enhancement Opportunity:**
- Emphasize the Politics dimension as unique differentiator: "Most assessments ignore the #1 reason AI initiatives fail—organizational politics. We don't."
- Add stat: "70% of AI implementation challenges relate to people and processes, not technology. Our Assessment addresses all five dimensions."

---

## CONCLUSION

The research validates Tributary's existing Assessment framework while identifying opportunities for enhancement. The five-dimension model (plus Governance) is well-aligned with industry best practices, and the weighted scoring approach correctly prioritizes Data as the foundational dimension.

**Key Actions:**
1. Consider adding 2-3 quiz questions to address gaps (lineage, MLOps, collaboration)
2. Enhance Assessment deliverables with maturity scores and benchmarks
3. Create content around the unique Politics dimension
4. Leverage statistics throughout website to build credibility

The Assessment service is well-positioned as organizations increasingly recognize that AI success depends on organizational readiness, not just technology selection.
